This project serves the purpose to provide remote control of telescope covers that prevent dust from covering the front lense of telescopes.

Hardware requirements:
- Arduino
- Servo motors (one for each moving cover)
- Cover material for covering the front opening of the telescope
- Mounting material to attach the servo to the dew shield of the telescope
- Housing for Arduino
- push buttons for each cover if manual operation is wanted

Software:
- .ino file with code for the Arduino (see code for details on attaching servos to PINs)
- .py Python script to control open / close operations via command line
- .html front-end to use a web browser to open / close the cover

Addition in October 2017:
- 3D sketch for 3D printing of a telescope clamp that attaches to the dew shield of an AstroPhysics Starfire 155EDF and that provides the hosuing of a servo.
